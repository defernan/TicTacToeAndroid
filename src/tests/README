TESTING
=======

Each directory corresponds to a test suite. Within each test suite, each C file
(.c extension) is a single test. If the .c file, when compiled, exits with a
status code of 0, the test is considered a success. If the program exits with a
status code other than 0, then the test is considered a failure.

Each .c test file may make multiple assertions. For the purpose of grading,
each file passes or fails as a unit.
